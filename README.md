# 🔦 The Real Dark Mode

Ever thought dark mode wasn't dark enough? Well, now the entire web becomes pitch black except where your cursor shines! ✨

Turn your cursor into a flashlight and explore websites like you're in a cave. Because regular dark mode is for beginners.

## 🎯 What does it do?

- Makes **everything** black (I mean EVERYTHING)
- Your cursor becomes a magical torch 🔦
- Move around to reveal content like a spotlight
- Completely customizable beam size, darkness level, and softness
- Works on every website (yes, even that one)

## 🎮 Features

- **Adjustable beam radius** - From laser-focused to wide lantern
- **Darkness intensity** - Choose your level of void
- **Edge softness** - Sharp spotlight or gentle glow
- **Easy toggle** - On/off with one click
- **Real-time updates** - Changes apply instantly

## 🤷‍♂️ Why I built this?

I spent my weekend building the most unnecessary portfolio feature - a real dark mode 🔦

Your cursor is now a flashlight. Everything else? Complete darkness. Move around to read. That's it.

Honestly, it's completely useless but ridiculously fun.

Perfect for:
- Late night browsing without burning your retinas
- Making boring websites feel like treasure hunting
- Pretending you're in a horror movie
- Showing off your "unique" browsing experience
- Weekend procrastination projects
